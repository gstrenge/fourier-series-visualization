# Fourier Series Visualization
While taking circuits and signals, to help better learn the concept behind fourier transforms/fourier series, I programmed this simple visualization of sinusoidal signals added together in a commonly-done style of visualizing this concept. The code is not well polished as this was a quick and dirty fun project.
